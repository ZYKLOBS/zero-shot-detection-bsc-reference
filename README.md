This is just reference code I used for my bachelor thesis which explored the ideas for Zero-Shot detection of AI generated images by https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15875 <br>
You can find my thesis here for further details: https://github.com/ZYKLOBS/Bachelor-Thesis  
It relies on getting the NLL and the Entropy of an image from this repo: https://github.com/ZYKLOBS/SREC-nll-entropy
