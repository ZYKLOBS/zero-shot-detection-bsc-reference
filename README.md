# AIID--Zero-Shot-Detection-of-AI-Generated-Images

AIID = AI Image Detector
(This was origanally planned to be a bigger project but that did not turn out well unfortunately) 

This now is just refereence code I used for my bachelor thesis, which you can find here: https://github.com/ZYKLOBS/Bachelor-Thesis 
It relies on getting the NLL and the Entropy of an image from this repo: https://github.com/ZYKLOBS/SREC-nll-entropy
